  <b>Crawling, Indexing, and Storage System for United Nations states Members Press Statements in Real Time.</b>
</p>


## Overview

This repository should provide much of the structure and parsing code needed to crawl and scrape various countries's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) web pages
contents with very little effort.
On launching our Diplomatic pulse scrapy crawlers, the Diplomatic Pulse clones our backend data: XPATHs of each country's
website layout to crawl and scrape the html contents.
