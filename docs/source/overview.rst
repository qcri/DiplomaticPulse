Overview
********
Diplomatic pulse is a crawling, indexing and storage system for United Nations Member States's press statements in Real Time.

It should provide much of the structure and parsing code needed to crawl and scrape various countries's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs `MFA`_ web pages contents with very little effort.
On launching our Diplomatic pulse scrapy crawlers, the Diplomatic pulse clones an existing website xpaths data: xpaths of each country's `website`_ to crawl and scrape html contents.
