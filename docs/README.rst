Generating documentation
========================
You will need Python and make installed. Use pip to install dependencies from
``requirements.txt`` by issuing the command ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

You will also need ``make`` just run ``make html`` in root folder and documentation
will be generated in ``build/html`` folder which you can copy/deploy to any web
server.
