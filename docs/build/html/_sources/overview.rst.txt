Overview
********
Diplomatic pulse is a crawling, indexing and storage system for United Nations Member States: released statements in Real Time.

It should provide much of the structure and parsing code needed to crawl and scrape webpages contents in Ministry of Foreign Affairs `MFA`_ with very little effort.
On launching the Diplomatic pulse crawlers, the system clones our existing website xpaths data: xpaths of each country's `website`_ to crawl and scrape html contents.

have developed the Diplomatic pulse system as search engine service for all press statements of the UN Member States, including
their Foreign Ministries and Permanent Missions to the UN.

It is built using free open source website crawling technologies which is `Scrapy`_ framework.
